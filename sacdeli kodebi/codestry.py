# Instructions:
#  Store the sum of two numbers a and b in a variable result.
# Test Cases:
#  assert result == 5 when a = 2, b = 3
#  assert result == 0 when a = -1, b = 1
#  assert result == 30 when a = 10, b = 20
a = 2
b = 3
print(a + b)
a = -1
b = 1
print(a + b)
a = 10

# Instructions:
#  Given two boolean values a and b, store the result of a and b in result.
# Test Cases:
#  assert result == True when a = True, b = True
#  assert result == False when a = True, b = False
a = "True"
b = "True"
print(a and b)
a = "True"
b = "False"

# Instructions:
#  Compare if a is greater than b and store the result in result.
# Test Cases:
#  assert result == True when a = 5, b = 3
#  assert result == False when a = 2, b = 7

a = 5
b = 3  
print(a > b)

#  Get the length of a list and store it in result.
# Test Cases:
#  assert result == 3 when list = [1, 2, 3]
#  assert result == 0 when list = []
listn =  [1,2,3]

res = len(listn) 

# Instructions:
#  Use a for loop and range() to compute the sum of numbers from 0 to 4 and store it in result.
# Test Cases:
#  assert result == 10
